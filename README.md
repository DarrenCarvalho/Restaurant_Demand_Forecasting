Main Dataset - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WFgbXtClNiModxqTcuBcKutUAK6NBv7s/view?usp=sharing 
\nData Files post preprocessing - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ygXdnitJ3oS87xoCJDiooZa9BathHOHe/view?usp=sharing
Modelling Datasets - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IEs_sK6zlvfc38nDVEEf_za_pVdxrUrA/view?usp=sharing 


1. Create a copy in drive for the main dataset and Data Files Post pre processing
2. Copy that path to Google Colab (Note for the modelling.ipynb file you only need to copy modelling dataset)
3. All initial commands in the colab file are extracting the zip file. You just need to change respective path based on your loaction of the file
4. Note: Create a copy in drive does not use up your drive storage

# For testing models 
1. Every model has been saved in the models folder
2. Execute the commented code for save / load model which is 3 lines after every model

# Execution Time 
1. Restaurant_Demand_Forecasting.ipynb - 20 Mins
2. Restaurant_Demand_Forecasting_User_Dataset.ipynb - 5 Mins
3. Modelling.ipynb - 15 Mins
